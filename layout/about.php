                        <p class="AboutText">
                            I work professionally as a web developer and since I was in 2012 have been a fan of anime, otaku and japanese culture for nearly the past decade and has been something I loved to spend my free time searching the interwebs checking out websites about.
                            Unfortunately I haven't found a place where fans can show off our figures, manga, news, t-shirts, art and anime collections to the world.
                            Some of my favorite shows are One Piece, Samurai Champloo, School Rumble, Jojo Bizarre adventure and Welcome to the NHK.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day I would like to transform this website into a community hub where this can be possible, but currently I work a full time job and only have a limited amount of time in my day.
                            This will be a journey that Iâ€™m looking forward too while this project is in development I would like to share my thoughts and highlight cool anime rooms, merchandise, art and news.
                            So please give any feedback comments, support, suggestions or criticisms that you may have on the website and lets build a community together. :D
