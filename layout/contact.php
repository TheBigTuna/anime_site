I apologize if I do not reply to emails or social media messages right away. I work 40 hours a week and have some freelance side gigs. I will reply as soon as I can. If you do not hear from me after some time, feel free to message me again.

**As of right now, I am not accepting guest posts from outside writers for Raiâ€™s Anime Blog. However, I may be willing to write my own guest posts for other anime websites.**

If you want to reach out to me on social media to chat or say hi, or just want to follow my accounts for more anime, click the icons below. I am the most active on Twitter!
